# 🚀 Face ID/Touch ID Cognito Client - Ready to Test!

## What's Been Created

A complete client-side web application for Face ID/Touch ID authentication with Amazon Cognito:

### 📁 Project Structure

faceid_cognito/
├── src/
│   ├── config.js          # Cognito & WebAuthn configuration
│   ├── webauthn.js        # Face ID/Touch ID service
│   ├── cognito-auth.js    # Cognito authentication service
│   ├── index.js           # Main application logic

├── server.js              # HTTPS server for local testing
├── build.js               # Simple bundler
└── package.json           # Dependencies & scripts
```

### 🔧 Key Features Implemented
- ✅ WebAuthn integration for Face ID/Touch ID
- ✅ Cognito User Pool authentication
- ✅ Device capability detection
- ✅ Biometric registration & authentication
- ✅ Password fallback support
- ✅ HTTPS server with self-signed certificates
- ✅ Safari-optimized for Mac testing

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Cognito
Edit `src/config.js`:
```javascript
userPoolId: 'us-east-1_XXXXXXXXX',        // Your User Pool ID
userPoolWebClientId: 'xxxxxxxxxx',         // Your App Client ID  
domain: 'your-domain.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com'
```

### 3. Start Testing
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then open Safari → `https://localhost:3000`

## 🧪 Testing Flow

### Registration Test
1. Enter email & username
2. Click "Register with Biometrics" 
3. Safari prompts for Touch ID/Face ID
4. Complete biometric setup

### Authentication Test  
1. Enter username
2. Click "Sign In with Face ID/Touch ID"
3. Complete biometric verification
4. Successfully authenticated!

## 🔍 What Happens Under the Hood

1. **Device Detection**: Checks WebAuthn & biometric support
2. **Registration**: Creates WebAuthn credential with Face ID/Touch ID
3. **Storage**: Saves credential to localStorage (demo only)
4. **Authentication**: Uses stored credential for biometric login
5. **Cognito Integration**: Connects to your User Pool via custom auth flow

## 🛠 Prerequisites for Testing

- ✅ macOS with Touch ID or Face ID
- ✅ Safari browser (recommended)
- ✅ Touch ID/Face ID enabled in System Preferences
- ✅ AWS Cognito User Pool with custom auth flow
- ✅ Lambda triggers configured (you mentioned you have these)

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Uses HTTPS (required for WebAuthn)
- Self-signed certificates for local testing
- Biometrics never leave your device
- Demo uses localStorage (production needs secure backend)

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

**"WebAuthn Not Supported"**
→ Use Safari with HTTPS enabled

**Certificate Warning**  
→ Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost"

**Touch ID Not Working**
→ Check System Preferences → Touch ID & Password

**Face ID Not Working**
→ Ensure Face ID enabled in System Preferences

## 🎯 Ready to Test!

Your Face ID/Touch ID Cognito client is 100% ready. Just configure your Cognito settings and start testing the biometric authentication flow on your Mac!
